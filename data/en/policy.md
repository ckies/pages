## What are Cookies?

When visiting our website again with the same device, the information stored in the Cookies will either be sent back to our website ("First Party Cookies") or to another website to which the Cookie belongs ("Third Party Cookies").

As soon as you use our website actively (by continuing to surf on our website after the Cookie Banner has been displayed to you), you give your consent to the use of Cookies.

You may customize your [Cookie Settings](#settings) any time by activating or deactivating the different Cookie category. For more information on how to generally deactivate Cookies on your browser (including Strictly Necessary Cookies), see Section 4 below.

### Performance Cookies

Performance Cookies collect information on how our website is used in order for us to improve its appeal, content and functionality. These Cookies help us determine, for example, which sub-sites of our website are accessed and what content the users are most interested in. In particular, we register the number of access to each site and sub-sites, the time spent on our website, the sequence of the sites visited, which search terms led you to us, the country, region and city from which the website is accessed as well as the proportion of mobile devices accessing our website. Moreover, we register all movements, clicks and scrolling with the computer mouse in order to determine which sections of our website the users are most interested in. As a consequence, we are able to adjust the content of our website to meet the specific needs of our users and optimize our service. IP addresses, which have to be transmitted due to technical reasons, are automatically anonymized and therefore no link to individual users may be drawn by us.

We reserve the right to use the information gained through the anonymized analysis of the user behavior via Cookies also in order to display to you specific advertisement for certain products of ours on our own websites. We believe that you as a user profit from this because we display advertisements and content we assume meet your interests on the basis of your surfing behavior.
